Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This is a test post to verify the content collection setup is working correctly. In the future, this space will be home to:

- **Homelab adventures** — self-hosting, Docker, networking
- **BJJ journeys** — training logs, technique notes, competition prep
- **Productivity systems** — ADHD strategies, PKM workflows, tools that actually work

Stay tuned for real content. For now, the plumbing is being tested.

## What's Next

I'm building this site with Astro 5, Svelte 5 islands, and Tailwind CSS 4, with a custom GVNS palette and typography system.

More posts coming soon.
